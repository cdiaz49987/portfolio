  <p> I do not know any similarites Python and Scratch have because I was not here for Scratch. <br/> 
  Today was fun. I enjoyed drawing shapes on python. I was hard because I did not know where to start but plugging<br/>
  in random code help me understand. However, I still need a lot of practice. </p>

    <p> I think I worked better in the group that many people didn't know alot like me because I didn't feel lost. <br/>
      When other people dont understand forces me to learn so I actually ask for help. if that makes sense.. </p>
